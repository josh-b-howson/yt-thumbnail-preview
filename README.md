# Youtube thumbnail preview tool

I sometimes make youtube videos so I made this for myself to see how my videos look in the search results compared to others.

Uses the Youtube Data API, Vue.js in Typescript with Vite, deployed on Vercel.

Test your video's thumbnail [here](https://yt-thumbnail-preview.joshhowson.com).

P.S. it has automatic light/dark theme preference support :)
